The aim is to save up your worrying for a 15 minute period every day. We call this your &#x27;<strong>Worry Time</strong>&#x27;.</p><p>How can you do this? There are two parts. You have to learn to notice when you start worrying and <strong>postpone</strong> this train of thought until your worry time.</p><p>Then you need a set time in a set place for the worry time.</p></div><div class="ui medium header">Step One: Postponing worry</div><hr style="border:2px solid #a7e9dc"/><div class="ui segment"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1544393569-eb1568319eef?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1350&amp;q=80" class="ui small right floated image"/><p><strong>What will you do when you notice yourself starting to worry?</strong> </p><p>Some people write down their worries to come back to later; some find an engaging activity that distracts their mind from it.

Other people learn to simply let the worry go.<!-- --> </p><p>It can be a little bit trial and error to begin with, and it may take some practise, but learning to postpone your worry is an incredibly powerful skill.</p></div><div class="ui medium header">Step Two: Managing your worries</div><hr style="border:2px solid #a7e9dc"/><div class="ui segment"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1620662736427-b8a198f52a4d?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1351&amp;q=80" class="ui small left floated image"/><p>During worry time, you have the freedom to worry as much as you like, you can really go wild with your worry. You can worry about anything you want to.</p><p>You need to set a time to worry for a 15 minute period, typically people often choose 6pm, because you will have any day time worries collected and you can get peace of mind well before bedtime. What time will you choose? It is important to make worrying as unappealing as possible, and it is recommended that you don&#x27;t do worry time in your bedroom or anywhere where you&#x27;d otherwise like to relax. The aim is to only worry whilst sitting in an upright chair at a table and not in bed, or in a comfy chair.</p><p>Where will you have your worry time?</p></div><br/><hr style="border:2px solid #a7e9dc"/><h4>Over time, with practise, you can improve the skill of delaying and postponing your worry and you can train your mind to worry less throughout the day.
