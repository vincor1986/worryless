However, it really helps to be optimistic and to carve out a positive vision of your future.</h4><h4>The brain is a muscle, and the more you exercise a muscle, the stronger it gets. One of the problems with worrying is that it exercises the brain in a bad way - training the mind to think of only the bad things that could happen.</h4><h4>By considering how brilliant life could be in the future, you are training your mind to be more optimistic. You can exercise the part of your brain that sees positive potentials and that can literally change the way you see the world.</h4><h4>It is recommended that you really go wild with your projections for your future. It is not a case of expecting that your future will be exactly like the optimistic vision you create. It is likely that there will be some negatives in your future, that&#x27;s only being realistic. But the aim of this activity is to exercise a part of your brain that has not been exercised much during your worry episodes. Plus, you may realise that life could be really great for you in the future and that could help you take steps today to make that dream a reality.</h4><h4>So really go wild with this activity and dare to dream! The more positive the better!</h4></div><br/><div class="ui huge header">So how do I do it?</div><hr style="border:2px solid #a7e9dc"/><br/><div class="ui cards"><div class="ui teal fluid card"><div class="content"><br/><div class="header">Write it down</div><div class="description">Sit down and consider how great life could be for you in five years time.

What will you do with them when you spend time together? What will they be like? Will you have the same friends as you do now or will you have new friends in your life? And how will they see you?

It may not all come true, but the idea is that you really think about how wonderful it would be to have this future and the hope is that this will help your subconscious mind find a path to it from your present.<br/><br/>It will also exercise that part of your brain that doesn&#x27;t get a look in when you are worrying. The positive, optimisitic, happy part of your brain.<br/><br/>You can re-write or edit the contents of your optimistic vision as you grow, as you may have a different vision in a year from now.</div></div><br/></div><br/><div class="ui teal fluid card"><div class="content"><br/><div class="header">(Optional) Record yourself reading it back</div><div class="description">This is for the advanced wannabe optimists.<br/><br/>By reading it back, and recording yourself, you are making a small commitment to take action and pursue this future. It will give you more time to really consider how great it would be to live the life detailed in your vision.<br/><br/>Once you have recorded it, you can listen to it back. Hearing yourself talk about your vision can be a powerful experience. The process of going through this exercise can empower your mind to be more optimistic about other areas of your life right now.<br/><br/>You can&#x27;t worry and be optimistic at the same time, after all.<br/><br/>And if you <strong>really</strong> want to drive home your vision, you could listen to the recording now and again while you sleep - to assist your unconscious mind in shifting its focus onto positive and optimistic things.</div></div><br/></div><br/><div class="ui teal fluid card"><div class="content"><br/><div class="header">Set yourself SMART goals</div><div class="description"><br/><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/28/SMART-goals.png" class="ui fluid image"/><br/><br/>Take <strong>three</strong> of your favourite ideas from your vision and set SMART goals that will take you towards those aspects of your vision.<br/><br/>Make sure that you are really specific about how those steps will take you towards those positive visions.<br/><br/>Try to make them as measurable as possible. Also try to make sure that they are achieveable.<br/><br/>Finally, set a time-target. It doesn&#x27;t matter if you don&#x27;t quite make your target. Chances are that you will be doing better if you are aiming for these targets than if you aren&#x27;t. It&#x27;s okay if you don&#x27;t succeed, because as Mohammed Ali once said &quot;If you aim for the stars, you just might make it to the moon&quot;.</div></div><br/></div></div><br/><div class="ui teal message"><h3><strong>Keep practising being optimistic!</strong></h3><br/>When we are worrying, we are weakening our ability to be optimistic, but when we are optimistic, we are tearing down the barriers in our brains that prevent us from giving ourselves permission to be positive. So keep reading or listening to your vision and keep strengthening the skill of being optimistic about your future.</div></div><br/><hr style="border:2px solid #a7e9dc"/><br/><div><div align="center" class="ui teal message">Worry Less © Vincent Coraldean 2021</div><br/></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/techniques/positive-vision","query":{},"buildId":"fU-8rqZaJhwX0sWM5RtN5","assetPrefix":"/worryless","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
