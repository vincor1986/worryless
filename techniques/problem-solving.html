It is human nature to focus on negative things. We all do it. The problem is that when this sort of worrying gets out of hand - it can be really hard not to worry about every thing... big and small. That can be emotionally and physically exhausting.</h4><h4>For some people it&#x27;s possible to just stop worrying about this stuff. Some people are naturally able to just keep worrying to the things within their control - or only when there is an immediate, irrefutable danger.</h4><h4>However, for many of us, things aren&#x27;t so simple. Many of us need support and guidance to pull away from persistant worrying.</h4><h4>That is where the Problem Solving Framework comes in.</h4></div><br/><div class="ui huge header">The Worry Tree</div><hr style="border:2px solid #a7e9dc"/><br/><h4>This is the &quot;Worry Tree&quot;, from Christina G Hibbert, Psy.D. -<!-- --> <a href="http://www.drchristinahibbert.com">www.drchristinahibbert.com</a></h4><img style="border:4px solid #a7e9dc;border-radius:20px" src="https://i.ibb.co/fMqJXRL/worry-tree.jpg" class="ui fluid image"/><br/><h4>The main two things to take from this are:</h4><div class="ui teal segment"><div role="list" class="ui list"><a role="listitem" class="item"><i aria-hidden="true" class="right triangle small icon"></i><div class="content"><div class="header">Let go of your worries if you can&#x27;t do anything about it.</div></div></a><a role="listitem" class="item"><i aria-hidden="true" class="right triangle small icon"></i><div class="content"><div class="header">If you can do something about it, take action as soon as possible.</div></div></a></div></div><h4>Using this framework, you can simplify your worrying experience. You can run your problems through this filter and it will tell you how to approach the situation.</h4><h4>This should take a lot of the hard work out of worrying, because you will likely find that many of the things you were worrying about fall into the category of things you can&#x27;t do anything about. In these cases, worrying won&#x27;t solve anything, so there&#x27;s nothing to gain from it.</h4><h4>That just leaves those problems that you can do something about. If you know you can do something positive to help the situation, then the sooner you take action, the better.</h4><h4>In the eventuality that there is something you&#x27;ll be able to do in the future, but there is nothing to be done at the moment - then you should try to let go of the worries until then.
