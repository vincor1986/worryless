He knows how exhausting it can be to worry about every little thing.</p><p>Every religious text has guidance for how to live life, what to worry about, and what not to worry about. Your faith can simplify life so that you can just focus on getting closer to God and following the guidance that God has laid before you.</p><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1499209974431-9dddcece7f88?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=750&amp;q=80" class="ui medium right floated image"/><p>Having a personal relationship with God can empower you with the strength, patience and humility that a person needs to move through trying times. By remembering that God wants the best for you, that God is looking over you, you can take comfort and peace in the knowledge that God has things under control.</p><p>It&#x27;s so easy to forget this in modern times. There are so many things to get stressed out about. So many things we consider worthy of our worry. Our worries can even get in the way of our faith if we let them. We can get swept up in worrying about all the little things that when a big worry comes along it knocks us down - and we can end up feeling that God is not helping us, or that with all these worries going on - we don&#x27;t have time for God.</p><p>But this section is written to show you that the opposite is true. Getting closer to God is one of the best ways you can handle your worry.</p><br/><div class="ui huge header">So how can faith help with worry?</div><hr style="border:2px solid #a7e9dc"/><br/><h3>Here are some of the ways that practising faith can help with worry:</h3><br/><div class="ui cards"><div class="ui teal fluid card"><div style="background-color:#bcf5ef" class="content"><div align="center" class="header">Prayer</div></div><div class="content"><img style="border-radius:50%" src="https://i.ibb.co/B30k0dr/prayer.png" class="ui large left floated image"/><h3>When we pray to God about our worries, we give them over to Him to deal with them. This can be a great relief, as many of the things we worry about may be out of our control - but they are well within the control that God has in our lives. God can do anything, and can handle all of our worries. God actually wants us to hand over our worries to Him, as it demonstrates faith and humility.</h3><h3>Praying gives us hope, and can lead to practical resolutions of worries that we may have. Think of it as going to the highest authority with your concern, there is no better action you can take. And sometimes God will respond with an answer: a solution, peace of mind, a new option that didn&#x27;t exist before.</h3><h3>There is no problem that God can&#x27;t solve. Prayer is a powerful tool, and one of the best ways to fight back against worry.</h3></div></div><br/><div class="ui teal fluid card"><div style="background-color:#bcf5ef" class="content"><div align="center" class="header">Worship</div></div><div class="content"><img style="border-radius:50%" src="https://i.ibb.co/51qVzd0/worship.png" class="ui large left floated image"/><h3>Worshipping God is our way of revering, elevating and honouring Him. When we do this, we accept that He is so much greater than us, and that He is powerful and worthy of praise. These things help to remind us that God is in control, and also reaffirm to us that us and our problems are usually insignificant in the bigger scheme of things.</h3><h3>Worship is also great, because while we give praise and reverance to God, we also take our attention away from ourselves. Most of our worries place us at the center of our attention, and this can be a difficult habit to break. Through worship, we encourage our brains to look outwards, to look to God and to place Him in the center of our attention, in a deeply concentrated and personal way.</h3><h3>Whether you sing praises or recite worship to God, the act of worship is unlikely to make you worry more, but it could just help in some way.</h3></div></div><br/><div class="ui teal fluid card"><div style="background-color:#bcf5ef" class="content"><div align="center" class="header">Reading</div></div><div class="content"><img style="border-radius:50%" src="https://i.ibb.co/njhSg1d/book.png" class="ui large left floated image"/><h3>Reading your holy book is a great way to prevent worrying. Within it, you can find guidance for how to interpret the world, how to respond to specific problems and how you should think and feel about certain subjects. It can provide you with the wisdom and structure to make decisions and provide new perspectives on worries that you have.</h3><h3>There are a wealth of websites that tailor faith-based advice for specific common worries and issues that believers may come across in life. Some texts also have similar sections near the front or back to help readers find what they are looking for. These texts have often stood the test of time and served followers well for hundreds of years.</h3><h3>If you have any questions about something you find in the text, a google search may provide added insight into the scripture, and there are plenty of chat rooms and internet groups that are willing to discuss these sorts of things online.</h3></div></div></div><br/><div class="ui huge header">Your faith can guide you</div><hr style="border:2px solid #a7e9dc"/><br/><p>Many believers rely on their faith to guide them and that takes so much pressure away from having to worry about this or that.</p><p>By turning to God when you are worried, you can get the sense that you are doing something about it and seeking answers, inspiration or solutions. Sometimes, all we need is the comfort that comes from knowing that God is there, listening and understanding us.</p><br/><div class="ui teal message"><h2>More about managing worries with faith</h2><p>&quot;I want to be settled and centered on Christ rather than eaten up and worn down by worry, annoyance, and discontent.&quot;<!-- --> <a href="https://faithspillingover.com/2014/08/25/more-jesus-less-fretting-and-fuming/">- betsydecruz - faithspillingover.com</a></p><p>&quot;No one can pray and worry at the same time.&quot; - Max Lucado</p><p>&quot;Knowing that God is faithful, it really helps me to not be captivated by worry.
