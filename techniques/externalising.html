This is especially useful when a swarm of worries is taking over your thoughts and things seem really intense.</h4><h4>This works for several reasons:</h4><div role="list" class="ui list"><a role="listitem" class="item"><i aria-hidden="true" class="right triangle small icon"></i><div class="content"><div class="header">You can get the worry out of your mind</div><br/><div class="description">Being able to put it down on paper gives your brain a chance to forget about the worry for some amount of time. Because it is written down and you can look at it later, it gives your brain permission to forget about the worry until a later time when you may see things differently or have a solution to the problem.</div></div></a><br/><a role="listitem" class="item"><i aria-hidden="true" class="right triangle small icon"></i><div class="content"><div class="header">You can see the problem more clearly</div><br/><div class="description">Putting the worry down in concise words will force your brain to break the problem down into logical chunks. You may find yourself re-writing the worry as you re-organise your thoughts and try to undersand what you are thinking and feeling. By going through the process, you are destructuring the problem, and this may help you to better understand the issue or to see things differently by the time you&#x27;re finished.</div></div></a><br/><a role="listitem" class="item"><i aria-hidden="true" class="right triangle small icon"></i><div class="content"><div class="header">You can review previous worries</div><br/><div class="description">Sometimes, when you revisit previous worries, you realise that you had nothing to worry about. It can be difficult to realise that worry is unhelpful if we constantly move from one worry to another. However, by reviewing worries from last week, last month or even last year - we can often see that we were worried about something trivial and we can learn through experience that our worry didn&#x27;t help us in the past and therefore perhaps it isn&#x27;t helping us now.</div></div></a></div></div><div class="ui huge header">Further tips</div><hr style="border:2px solid #a7e9dc"/><br/><p>If you find this helpful, you may want to keep a worry diary or a journal.

Release all those cooped-up worries from the corners of your mind, and let the paper deal with them.
